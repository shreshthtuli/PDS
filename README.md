# PDS
Indian "Public Distibution System" design by Shreshth Tuli (2016CS10680). <br/>
Indian food security system, established by the Government of India under Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution is to distribute subsidized food and non-food items to India's poor. This scheme was first launched in February 1944, during the Second World War and was launched in the current form in June 1947. Major commodities distributed include staple food grains, such as wheat, rice, sugar and kerosene, through a network of fair price shops (also known as ration shops) established in several states across the country. Food Corporation of India, a Government-owned corporation, procures and maintains the PDS.

The public distribution system of India is not without its defects. With a coverage of around 40 million below-poverty-line (BPL) families, a review of the PDS has discovered the following structural shortcomings and disturbances:[6]
1. Growing instances of the consumers receiving inferior quality food grains in ration shops.[7]
2. Deceitful dealers replace good supplies received from the F.C.I(Food Corporation of India) with inferior stock and sell FCI stock in the black market.
3. Illicit fair price shop owners have been found to create large number of bogus cards to sell food grains in the open market.
4. Many FPS dealers resort to malpractice, illegal diversions of commodities, holding and black marketing due to the minimum salary received by them.[8]
5. Numerous malpractices make safe and nutritious food inaccessible and unaffordable to many poor thus resulting in their food insecurity.[9]
6. Identification of households to be denoted status and distribution to granted PDS services has been highly irregular and diverse in various states. The recent development of Aadhar UIDAI cards has taken up the challenge of solving the problem of identification and distribution of PDs services along with Direct Cash Transfers.
7. Regional allocation and coverage of FPS are unsatisfactory and the core objective of price stabilization of essential commodities has not met.
8. There is no set criteria as to which family is BPL and which is APL .This non ambiguity gives massive scope for corruption and fallouts in PDS systems because those who are actually meant to be benefitted are not able to taste the fruits of PDS.

To tackle such problems the write presents throught this repo, a suggestive solution.
